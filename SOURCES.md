## Methodology Notes

### Data Collection
- Layoff numbers sourced from official company announcements, SEC filings, and Layoffs.fyi
- Outage data collected from DownDetector reports, ThousandEyes analyses, and official status pages
- Cross-referenced with major tech news outlets (The Verge, TechCrunch, Reuters, CNN, NPR)

### Incident Classification
An "incident" or "major outage" is defined as:
- Service disruption affecting 10,000+ users
- Duration of 30+ minutes
- Reported on DownDetector with 1,000+ user reports
- Officially acknowledged by company or widely covered in tech press

### Limitations
- Not all outages are publicly reported
- Small incidents may not be captured in tracking tools
- DownDetector data reflects reported issues, not total affected users
- Some incidents may have multiple causes beyond staffing levels
- Company internal reliability metrics are not publicly available
