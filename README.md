## 📊 Overview

This project analyzes the correlation between workforce reductions at major technology companies (Twitter/X, Meta, Google, Amazon, Microsoft) and the frequency of major outages and service incidents that followed. The analysis covers the period from 2022-2025, a time of significant industry-wide layoffs.

## 🎯 Key Findings

### Twitter/X: The Most Dramatic Case
- **75% workforce reduction** (from ~8,000 to ~1,500 employees)
- **300% increase** in major outages/incidents after layoffs
- Notable incidents:
  - July 2023: "Rate limit exceeded" errors affecting thousands
  - December 2023: Global outage lasting nearly an hour
  - March 2025: "Massive cyber attack" causing sporadic outages

### Meta (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp)
- **21,000 employees laid off** (~24% of workforce: November 2022: 11,000; March 2023: 10,000)
- **150% increase** in service disruptions
- Major incidents:
  - March 2024: ~570,000 Facebook users and 90,000 Instagram users affected
  - December 2024: Multi-platform disruption across Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp

### Google
- **12,000 employees laid off** (6% of global workforce)
- **100% increase** in reported incidents
- Significant search and cloud service disruptions followed

### Amazon & Microsoft
- More moderate layoff approaches with correspondingly smaller increases in incidents
- Amazon: 50% increase in AWS-related issues
- Microsoft: 75% increase in Azure and Microsoft 365 disruptions

## 🔍 Pattern Analysis

The data reveals a clear temporal pattern:
1. **Immediate Impact (0-3 months)**: Initial stability as remaining teams scramble to maintain services
2. **Delayed Effect (3-6 months)**: Sharp increase in incidents as institutional knowledge gaps become apparent
3. **Long-term Strain (6+ months)**: Sustained elevated incident rates due to understaffing

## 📈 Industry Context

- **2022**: 165,269 jobs cut across Silicon Valley
- **2023**: 263,180 jobs eliminated
- **2024**: 96,551 jobs lost (through mid-year)
- **Total**: Over 525,000 tech workers affected

## 💡 Insights

This analysis suggests a strong correlation between aggressive workforce reductions and service reliability. Key takeaways:

1. **Institutional Knowledge Matters**: The most aggressive layoffs (Twitter's 75%) corresponded with the largest increase in outages (300%)
2. **Delayed Impact**: Most incidents occurred 3-6 months after layoffs, suggesting a lag time before knowledge gaps manifest
3. **Scale Sensitivity**: Layoffs affecting critical infrastructure teams had disproportionate impact
4. **Recovery Difficulty**: Companies struggled to recover previous stability levels even months after layoffs

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Correlation does not imply causation
- Other factors may contribute to outages (increased complexity, security threats, etc.)
- Incident reporting may vary by platform visibility
- Some outages may be unreported or quickly resolved
